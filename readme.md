# Workforce Link - Support Worker Test Data Generator

This is a Node JS script used to automatically generate Support Worker test data for the [candidate database](https://github.com/tjohnston-softdev/worklink-database) that I designed for Workforce Link's IT system. Since test data is sometimes too tedious to create manually, and most tools are relatively simple, this script had to be tailor-made for the database, it's rules, and our specific requirements.

## Background

After I designed the Workforce Link database, I started to implement the [back-end API](https://github.com/tjohnston-softdev/worklink-api-orig). Of course, once I had functional endpoints, I needed to populate the database with test data. For most tables, this was simple enough to do by hand or use available online tools. However, the data structure related to Support Workers was too complex for these tools to generate test data that works exactly as-is.

Rather than trying to make the best of those limitations, I set about writing my own script to generate Support Worker test data. Since the project as a whole had a hard deadline, I really did not have the time to come up with anything spectacular. The end result was very messy and unrefined. It ran primarily on [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/), using embedded scripts to randomly choose values and create full objects. In summary, it was not my best work but it had served it's purpose.

When I decided to revisit this project for my public portfolio and come up with test data, I felt a sense of déjà vu. Most of the tables can be populated by hand but when it comes to Support Workers, an automatic generation script is necessary. The main difference is that now, I was able to sit down and write a script that I was happy with rather than just trying to tick a few boxes. Even though being unemployed in the software industry is a full-time job in itself, I still find myself having way too much free time and misplaced energy... I need help.

## Installing

1. Clone this repository and execute `npm install`
2. To generate test data, execute `node generate`
3. To customize different data generation parameters, see `options.json`
4. Output SQL files are saved to the `output-files` folder.

The test data generated by this script is meant to be used alongside the [Workforce Link database](https://github.com/tjohnston-softdev/worklink-database). Refer to that repository for more details on how to set up an instance.
